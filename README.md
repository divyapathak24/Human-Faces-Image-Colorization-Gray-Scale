# Human-Faces-Image-Colorization-Gray-Scale
Gray scale image colorization finds an application in various domains. Nowadays, many cameras are still capturing gray scale images due to simplicity of storage and processing of these images. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), surveillance and satellite images are gray scale images. Gray scale images are the ones which possess only one channel that is the lightness channel. 

We have created an Auto Encoder Model CNN based model with Encoder-Decoder Network.

Google Colab platform is used for the training purpose.

We have trained the network on 500 Gray scale images with 128x128 dimension.
